### **What our project is about:**

## RateMyGym is a web application where users can provide ratings and comments about local gyms regarding many factors such as price, availability of equipment, location, and general environment. RatingMyGym has been built in collaboration with Ruby on Rails but following Object-Oriented guidelines of the MVC architecture. The minimum increased features for security of a login system are implemented, along with a future User Profile page where users will be able to update their account information and update their activity. When the user chooses a gym and leaves a review, the system will add this new review to the creation of the general rating of the gym and the breakdown of reviews for certain ones, since the users can visualize aggregated ratings for factors such as machines, staff, cleanliness, atmosphere, etc. The frontend provides an intuitive interface done via HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; the backend manages user authentication, data storage, and the dynamic showing of information and reviews regarding the gym in a very efficient way. PostgreSQL is used for database management, and best practices were followed in development, including feature tracking and version control through GitHub.

Retrospective for Iteration 2

What Went Wrong:

Incomplete Feature Development:

1) We were unable to implement the filtering through reviews feature, which would have allowed users to sort reviews based on various criteria. Additionally, the likes and dislikes feature was not developed. This hindered our ability to enhance user interaction and engagement with the reviews. 

2) We were unable to complete the process of placing the 'writing the review section', which is on the review page, on a separate button so that the page's layout looks cleaner. 

Review Creation Challenges:

We faced difficulties in creating a review due to popup error handling. Users encountered messages that were not user-friendly, which affected their ability to submit reviews successfully. We identified these errors and created custom handling to provide clearer feedback to users.

Error Handling and User Experience:

The initial error messages were vague and not presentable, leading to confusion among users. We recognized the need for a better user experience and updated the error handling messages to be more informative and visually appealing.

Back Button Issues:

The back button functionality did not work as intended. After troubleshooting, we discovered that the problem stemmed from incorrect redirection paths. This issue required additional attention to ensure users could seamlessly navigate to previous pages.

How We Solved It:

To address the review creation challenges, we refined the error messages, ensuring they were more descriptive and aligned with user expectations. This change improved the overall user experience when submitting reviews.

For the back button issue, we reviewed the redirection paths in our application. Once we corrected these paths, users could navigate back without any problems, enhancing the fluidity of their experience on the platform.

Things to Improve:


Feature Completion:

Prioritize the development of the filtering feature for reviews and the likes/dislikes feature in future iterations. These additions are critical for enhancing user engagement and feedback mechanisms.

Enhanced User Feedback:

Continue to refine error handling and user feedback mechanisms to ensure they are clear, concise, and visually engaging. This will help reduce confusion and improve user satisfaction.

Comprehensive Testing:

Implement a more robust testing strategy to catch issues related to redirection and feature functionality earlier in the development process.

Improved Collaboration:

Foster better communication within the team regarding feature responsibilities and timelines to ensure all features are developed as planned.

Documentation and Tracking:

Utilize GitHub Issues more effectively for feature tracking and documentation of ongoing tasks, which will help keep the team aligned and accountable.

#### Things to be improved:

- **Aesthetic enhancements**: Enhance the design and structure of all pages for a more interactive user experience, making it easy on the eyes.
- **Review visibility**: Interlink individual reviews such that all users can be able to access other users' reviews, instead of having them stored and visible only locally.
- **Server Connection**: It should be connected to the application server so that reviews stored and gotten are directly from the database and not just on the local end.
- **Review deletion**: Allow users to delete reviews they've posted, giving more control to users over what they post.
- **General rating of gym**: Introduce a feature to sum up the total reviews and come up with an overall rating for each gym about individual ratings.
- **Filter reviews**: Filtering options for reviews according to a particular criterion that the user prefersâ€”whether latest or highest rated.
- **Improved data extraction**: Refine the review process by asking for better questions and specific sections that justify users' ratings in order to enhance the quality of feedback.
- **Back button**: Introduce the option for having a back button on review pages for easier access to either the previous pages or the gym listing.

## More changes to come.

### Testing and Code Quality

Test cases and results:

We have implemented automated testing using Rails' built-in test framework to ensure that key functionality in the application works as expected. Below are the details of our testing process for the login functionality and how it passes.

Test Scenario: User Login
Test File: test/controllers/sessions_controller_test.rb
Description: This test verifies the login functionality of the application, ensuring that:
Users can log in with valid credentials.
Users cannot log in with invalid credentials (and a 422 Unprocessable Entity status is returned).
A proper response is received upon logging out.
Expected Results:
A user with valid credentials should be logged in successfully and redirected to the home page.
A user with invalid credentials should see an error message and the login page should be re-rendered with a 422 Unprocessable Entity status.
A user logging out should be redirected to the login page with a logout success message.

Actual Results:
Running 3 tests in a single process (parallelization threshold is 50)
Run options: --seed 46646

# Running:

...

Finished in 1.358292s, 2.2087 runs/s, 5.8897 assertions/s.
3 runs, 8 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips

Conclusion:
The tests passed successfully, as indicated by 0 failures and 0 errors, confirming that the login, logout, and invalid login functionalities work as expected

Review Functionality Testing:
We have implemented automated testing using Rails' built-in test framework to ensure that key functionality in the application works as expected. Below are the details of our testing process for the review functionality and how it passes.

Test Scenario: Review Submission
Test File: test/controllers/reviews_controller_test.rb
Description: This test verifies the review submission functionality of the application, ensuring that:

Users can successfully add a review when logged in.
Users cannot add a review when not logged in (and are redirected appropriately).
Expected Results:

A logged-in user should be able to submit a review successfully, and the review should be added to the gym's page.
A user who is not logged in should be redirected to the login page when attempting to submit a review.

Actual Results:
Running 2 tests in a single process (parallelization threshold is 50)
Run options: --seed 17188

# Running:

..

Finished in 1.370940s, 1.4589 runs/s, 4.3766 assertions/s.
2 runs, 6 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips

Conclusion:
The tests passed successfully, as indicated by 0 failures and 0 errors, confirming that the review submission functionality works as expected, allowing users to add reviews when logged in and restricting access when not logged in..


### Instructions for running:
1) Make sure that you have Ruby version 3.3.5 or later installed
2) MAke sure you have Rails version 7.2.1 installed
3) Also make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and that it runs properly
4) Clone the repository
5) Then install all the dependencies by running the command 'bundle install'
6)  Then set up the database by running the commands:
'rails db:create'
'rails db:migrate'

7) Next seed the database using the command 'rails db:seed'
8) Now you can start the rails server with the command 'rails server'
9) on the terminal navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view our application !
